# Student Habit Builder PWA

A local-first Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to help university students build and maintain consistent study habits using the principles of *Atomic Habits*.

## 🎯 Vision

The goal is to move beyond simple to-do lists and focus on **Identity-Based Habits**. By applying the Four Laws of Behavior Change, this app helps students become "consistent learners" through small, sustainable actions.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **Identity Onboarding:** Define who you want to become (e.g., "I am a disciplined scholar").
*   **Habit Stacking:** Link new habits to existing cues (e.g., "After I brush my teeth, I will...").
*   **Tiny Versions:** Every habit has a "2-minute version" to lower the barrier on difficult days.
*   **Focus Timer:** Built-in Pomodoro timer that automatically logs progress.
*   **Local-First & Offline:** All data is stored locally (IndexedDB). No internet required.
*   **Analytics:** GitHub-style consistency heatmap and streak tracking.
*   **Data Export:** Full CSV export for backup and analysis.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite, TanStack Query, Dexie.js (IndexedDB).
*   **Backend:** Python, FastAPI (Support service).
*   **Infrastructure:** Docker, Docker Compose.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
